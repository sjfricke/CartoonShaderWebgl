## HOW TO USE

Grab the repo and put in folder and open a terminal/command prompt with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and "cd" your way to the folder

first run (this will load the libraries needed)
```sh
npm install
```

Then run
```sh
node app.js
```
This will create an instance of the server on port 9000 -
Go to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) to see it 

## IMPORTANT NOTES
    - For the moment being there is an altercation in the three.min.js library so DO NOT update three.js until fixed
